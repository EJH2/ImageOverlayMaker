# ImageOverlayMaker

A small script I use to put an image on other images. Not too useful for anything else, though.

# How To Use

To initiate the interactive script, run `python main.py`. If you run `python main.py fast`, the program will search the
current working directory, and place the image in the file "mask.png" on any other image file in the directory.
